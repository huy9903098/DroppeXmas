This is my task assignment for Droppe Frontend Developer positions.
View demo: [Droppe Xmas demo](https://droppe-xmas.vercel.app/).

## Opening the application

First, build the application:

```bash
yarn build
```

Second, run the build:

```bash
yarn start
```

Third, run the test:

```bash
yarn test
```

Note: There is only one test, i didn't focus a lot on the test
Note: Sometimes there is CORS errors, since i can't control the API i can't do anything about it

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.
